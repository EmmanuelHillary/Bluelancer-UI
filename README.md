### Awesome 👍. You just created a fork and clone it to your PC.

### Next: Adding your contributions
Navigate to location where you cloned the repository and open it.<br/>
<span style="color: red">NOTE: the repository folder might already contain contributions (folders) from other members of the team</br>
Please do not edit or delete them, kindly follow the next step below to know how to add your contribution.</span></br>
After successfully forking and cloning the repository, you now need to add the files you just created.</br>
In other for the repository to be easily accessible by others, we have decided that each contribution should be in </br>
form of a folder and the name of the folder should be a brief description of what you worked on e.g landing_page, <br/> navigation_bar, footer_section etc. <br/>
Inside the folder you created, you should then add the files (HTML and/or CSS) for the part you worked on.</br>
